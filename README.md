# determinant_calculator
A C++ script to calculate the determinant of a custom matrix using Laplace Expansion implemented with recursion

### input
The first input is a number N, expressing the order of the matrix

The next NÂ² inputs are elements of the matrix, from top-left to bottom-right. In this version, these elements should only be integers.

To make it easier, is recommended to use a input file, specially with large matrices

### output
The determinant of the matrix.
